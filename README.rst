Migrations
----------

We're using [South][south] to handle database migrations.
To generate a schema migration, make changes to models.py, then run:

``./manage.py schemamigration peekaboo.main --auto``

To generate a blank data migration, use:

``./manage.py datamigration peekaboo.main data_migration_name``

Then fill in the generated file with logic, fixtures, etc.

To apply migrations:

``./manage.py migrate peekaboo.main``

In each command, replace peekaboo.main with the appropriate app.



Stackato
--------

To use `stackato <http://api.stacka.to/docs/>`_ you need to be log in and then you can
simply run::

    $ stackato push -n

Note: If it's already registered under that name you need to override
the name with something else.

If you make changes to the stackato.yml file run::

    $ stackato update -n
